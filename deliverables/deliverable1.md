# Adventure-Arena Game Project Interviews
Our group has decided to make an arena game with adventure elements. The player will be able to complete levels going from one unique arena to the next while progressing a story between each level. This game intends to provide a unique take on the action-adventure genre, which is heavily saturated with over-the-shoulder prospective, linear, narrative driven games. With a more arcade-style gameplay, we aim to provide players with a new and engaging experience while still maintaining the storytelling traditions of the genre.
## Value Statement
We provide fans of the action-adventure games with a novel approach to a highly saturated and repetitive genre by providing a new gameplay loop in the form of arena combat while still maintaining the story elements that fans of the genre expect and are accustomed to.
