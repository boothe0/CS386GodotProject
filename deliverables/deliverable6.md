## Tests

## Demo

## Code Quality

Our team adheres to the following policies in order to maintain high-quality, readable code: 
- We have explanatory comments added to every section of code for which it is necessary to clarify the code's purpose. These comments are brief, straightforward, and only added where needed, so our code is not overwhelmed with unnecessary comments.
- We apply consistent coding conventions, such as having regular spacing and using CamelCase for the names of all Godot nodes while using lowercase with underscores for functions and variable names, so that our code follows one uniform style.
- We keep our scripts as short as is feasible - for instance, our longest script is 306 lines long, and most other scripts don't go beyond 100 lines - in order to prevent scripts from becoming too complicated and lengthy. Moreover, each separate aspect of the game has a unique script assigned to it, so it is easy to find the code responsible for the functionality of different parts of the game.
- We separate blocks of code that have different purposes within a function or script using blank lines for increased readability.
- All our variable, constant, and function names are straightforward and descriptive - some examples are the variable dist_to_player, the function use_heal_potion, and the constant MAX_STAMINA - so their purpose in our program is very clear, and it is easy to understand exactly what task a piece of code is performing.
