## Design Patterns
1. The Composite Pattern
   - https://github.com/boothe0/CS386GodotProject/blob/main/cs386gameproject/scenes/main_scene.tscn
   - Implented directly into the Godot engine with scenes being structured as a tree
   - Each scene has a parent node which is composed of many other child nodes, each with thier own functionality
   - Follows the open/closed principle by extending scenes without modifying existing functionality
   - [PLACEHOLDER INSERT TREE SCREENSHOT]

2. The Singleton Pattern
   - https://github.com/boothe0/CS386GodotProject/blob/main/cs386gameproject/scripts/upgrades/player_variables.gd
   - Implemented directly into the Godot engine using the Autoload feature
   - Allows for global access of static player variables across scenes
   - [PLACEHOLDER INSERT AUTOLOAD SCREENSHOT]
