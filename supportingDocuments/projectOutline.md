# Project Outline

## Themes
The main character goes to an ancient greek underworld with an underlying story of going through trials to save a loved one.
- Will have unique art pieces to set itself apart from other titles that it could be compared to such
as Hades.
- Different settings of each trial to go through set up as an arena.
- Detailed character backstory and lore after each trial has passed. Good combination of humor 
and emotional moments.

## Game Implementations 
A magic system that works similar to how a bullet would work with different effects possibly particle 
effects if we can.
- Health system with unqiue art for showing health being taken away
- Movement system for top down view being mobile but not too much as to not take away from the difficulty of 
the game
- Have an enemy detection system to constantly attack the player using different movesets
- Different attack animations and patterns for various spells the player will have
- Attacks for different enemy types for each arena level.
- Can add more here later or take some away/modify

## Opening menu/Music
The game should have a distinct opening music theme and menu. Could make music using online software.
- Should have a start button and an animation when starting up the game to showcase the title.
