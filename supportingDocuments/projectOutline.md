# Project Outline

## Themes
The main character goes to an ancient greek underworld with an underlying story of going through trials to save a loved one.
- Will have unique art pieces to set itself apart from other titles that it could be compared to such
as Hades.
- Different settings of each trial to go through set up as an arena.
- Detailed character backstory and lore after each trial has passed. Good combination of humor 
and emotional moments.

## Game Implementations 
A magic system that works similar to how a bullet would work with different effects possibly particle 
effects if we can.
- Health system with unqiue art for showing health being taken away
- Movement system for top down view being mobile but not too much as to not take away from the difficulty of 
the game
- Have an enemy detection system to constantly attack the player using different movesets
- Different attack animations and patterns for various spells the player will have
- Attacks for different enemy types for each arena level.
- Can add more here later or take some away/modify

## Opening menu/Music
The game should have a distinct opening music theme and menu. Could make music using online software.
- Should have a start button and an animation when starting up the game to showcase the title.

## Setting
The current proposed setting is the ancient Greek underworld, with the player beginning at the entrance to the underworld and progressing deeper into different locations throughout the game (ex: the River Styx, Asphodel, the gates of horn and ivory).

## Characters
### Player Character
- Backstory: 
- Motivation: 
- Personality: 
### Additional Characters
- Could be characters from Greek mythology that the player character can interact with and receive advice or warnings from between the arena fights (ex: Thanatos, Charon, Hades)
- Likewise, the enemies the player battles could be mythological spirits and monsters such as the Furies, Cerberus, and the oneiroi

## Game Progression
- Can change this structure, this is just a very basic outline to start with
### Opening Scene
- This scene should introduce the plot and involve the player's descent into the underworld, providing a compelling introduction while not taking up too much time
### Level 1:
- Arena Setting: 
- Enemies: 
- Attacks: 
- Outcomes: 
### Interlude Scene
- A brief scene to provide more information about the player and story while moving the player to the next level
### Level 2: 
- Levels beyond 1 could include different sublevels, depending on the outcome of the previous level
- Arena Setting: 
- Enemies: 
- Attacks: 
- Outcomes:

- ... To be continued, depending on how much we have time to implement

## Endings
- Could feature different stories and artwork so the player is compelled to keep playing to achieve unique endings
