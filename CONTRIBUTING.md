# Introduction

### Thank You!
Thak you for contributing to this project! We know it's a required part of the class, but your contributions are very helpful!

# Ground Rules
### Expectations
Follow the coding and behavior standards set forth by the group and the standards outlined in our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/boothe0/CS386GodotProject/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

> Responsibilities
> * Test your changes thoroughly before you push them.
> * Comments are very useful to help everyone else understand your code.
> * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make.
> * Keep the number of changes per commit manageable. This makes it easier for us to go back and fix it.
> * Be available to attend most group meetings to ensure your feedback is shared with the rest of the group.

# Getting started
### Set Everything Up
> * We've established a guide on how to get your own local branch of the game working so that you can push your work upstream. It can be found on the [README](https://github.com/boothe0/CS386GodotProject/blob/main/README.md).
> * Make sure your branch is updated to the latest version to avoid conflicts. Test changes on your local branch to ensure integrity before pushing upstream.


# Code review process
### Pull Request Management
> * In order to maintain main branch integrity, all pull requests, no matter how small, must be reviewed by at least one other person before they can be merged.
> * This keeps our main branch safe, and ensures at least one other person has tested the code.
> * Reviewing and approving other members' pull requests when you can is also helpful.

# Communication
Everyone should already be invited to the Discord server. From there we can coordinate communications, including our weekly meetings. We try to have two per week, to ensure everyone can attend at least one.
