## 1.  Activity Summary

Describe what each individual has contributed to the project in the last week.  Provide some supporting documentation (e.g., an issue number, commit id, corresponding meeting date, etc.).  If someone didn't do anything, please be honest and explain why. **Activity that advances your project toward completion is expected every week and should be reflected in your Git repository!**



## 2. Retrospective

Appreciations: 
We're still pretty far ahead in terms of the project itself, and we met earlier in the week rather than meeting Sunday night before the report is due.

Successes: 
Getting a consistant schedule down for meetings, as well as more defined goals compared to the previous week, we have a much more unified idea of what the game is supposed to play like

Failures: Not having a mid-week meeting not having features fully ready before the report

Barriers: Working on a very barebones project makes it hard to test and implement new features.

What we should do next time: Have a midweek meeting, including a meeting schedule being posted by monday
