2. Retrospective

    Appreciations: We were good about working together and showing up to both meetings as a whole team and working together to solve common close issues.
   
    Successes: Everyone got their assigned goals completed.
   
    Failures: We all did our jobs this weeek  and got a lot done without a hitch.
   
    Barriers: Some parts of the code are very closely coupled to one another making it hard to add new features into existing scripts.
   
    What we should try next time.
    Code review to fix some of the older scripts getting rid of unused functions or repeated functions.
