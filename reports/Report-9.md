## 1. Activity Summary

Elizabeth:
- Added a rough inventory-buy system that connects the user's bought items to their inventory to prepare for use.

## 2. Retrospective

1. Aprreciations: All the work the artists have done so far in making the game assets look unique and refined.
2. Successes: Our team work on the deliverable is good and the styling looks consistant.
3. Failures: The code team does not have much collaboration going on.
4. Barriers: We had a hard time meeting up due to various reasons.
5. What we should try next time: We should try to plan our meetings early in the week so we can be prepared for when they come up. The 
coding team should choose some part of the game to work on together per week to lessen the load per person.

## 3. Next steps

Elizabeth:
- Add a buying animation and sound. Further refine the inventory-buy system that is currently implemented.
