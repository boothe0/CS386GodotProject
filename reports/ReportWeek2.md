## 1.  Activity Summary

Describe what each individual has contributed to the project in the last week.  Provide some supporting documentation (e.g., an issue number, commit id, corresponding meeting date, etc.).  If someone didn't do anything, please be honest and explain why. **Activity that advances your project toward completion is expected every week and should be reflected in your Git repository!**

Ethan: Created a temporary group of assets to use for initial developing. Added character movement and attacks, with enemy detection ai and attacking. Created projectile attacks that the player can use to defeat the enemies. Fixed a few bugs. Contributed to team discussions and helped think of the basic mechanics for the game.

Elizabeth: Created a project pannel to organize tasks to do each week. Connected godot to the github repository and set up a basic title menu to integrate with the main game. Set up a supporting documents folder with an outline of what our game will look like going forward and goals we have for implementations. Contributed ideas to the team and communicated any issues that arose on my end when they came up.

Asher: HP bar features and signal updates to when player takes damage, useful for future features. Also fixed bug behind player and enemy movement being blurry due to camera's rendering setting. 

Camelia: Expanded on the project planning document to include a template for the game layout. Took part in team discussions and contributed an idea for the theme and storyline of the game.

## 2. Retrospective

Appreciations: 
People that would respond when I needed further clarity about what the project is going to be about in more detail. The speed and in-depth testing that groupmates take to make sure features are correct in iterations of the game. We were able to connect godot to the version control system and utilize it effectivly right from the start.

Successes: 
We thought of the overall vision for the game, with a lot of ideas for different mechanics. We have a good basis to start from, and were able to divide the work based on our individual strengths.

Failures: Too early to say that we have had hiccups, we have a solid base for the game's design and we're already beginning progress on development

Barriers: Some lack of communication made it hard to get things going/finished in a timely manner. We had a hard time setting up a good time to meet up and discuss the project.

What we should do next time: Have a weekday check-in meeting to keep up to date with other members progress.
