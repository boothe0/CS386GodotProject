### 1. Activity Summary
****

Elizabeth - Added theme to title UI screen. Made a material and shader to move the title of the game so the screen
was not as static. Created placeholders on the right UI screen for consumables to be placed. 

Asher - Added modular consumable items, added global signaling for scripts to interact with each other. Added UI elements
for consumables with UI hints for consumable use. Fixed #33, added back enemy health bars. Reviewed and tested 3 pull requests.

Camelia - Finalized player character design and worked on design for enemies.

Ethan - Worked on created an item drop system upon enemy deaths, including coins and consumables

Chandler - Worked on adding collisions to map tiles.

### 2. Retrospective
****

Appreciations: We appreciate the overal code design so far of the game I feel like it is really easy to read and add to. We
also like the few art pieces and sketches that were made at this point.

Successes: We made some more progress on basic systems of the game such as UI and consumables. More planning was also
done this week on the overall vision of the game, art direction and what our MVP should be as a goal post.

Failures: We were unable to get everyone to  meet on the day the report and deliverable was due.

Barriers: Still having to work with premade assets is hindering some progress of the game to fully implement some features
such as UI, gear and consumables.

What we should try next time: Have better communication and update the group on what you are working on and ask for help 
if you need any. Utilizing the code resource discord channel to post helpful tutorials might be a good step in the right
direction.

### 3. Next steps

Asher - Start adding modular upgrades, purchasable in shop. Add round timer.
