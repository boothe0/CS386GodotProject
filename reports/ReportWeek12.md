## 2. Retrospective

Appreciations: The report was created and everyone was notified to fill it out.

Successes: We've started to work on the polishing parts of the development process that will give us a better end product.

Failures: Not a lot of communication this week, as well as commits into the repository

Barriers: Scheduling issues and high workloads around this time led to little work being done on the project.

What we should try next time: Start at the beginning of the week and pace out smaller commits over time.

## 3. Next Steps
Elizabeth: Creating the wall potion script.

Ethan: Will continue to work on this fast enemy (maybe make it steal coins), and continue with player shield

Maya: Start implementing the Upgrades and Consumables; Most likely starting with "Increase Dash Length: Marathon Sandals"

Asher: Fix some issues labeled as bugs

Chandler: Continue working on spawn solutions, like a placeable spawner

Camelia: Create new sprite for shopkeeper, work on ideas for central objective
