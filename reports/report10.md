## 1. Activity Summary
Elizabeth- Small UI fixes and did SOLID part of deliverable 5.

Chandler - Created the refined UML class diagram that covered implementation, created new level art assets, redesigned main scene and added new level objects.

Camelia - Created concept art for potential bosses and started work on sprite for player character's wife.

## 2. Retrospective

Appreciations: We all were able to get together at least once to finish another deliverable together.

Successes: We determined as a group how we were going to proceed with the next stage of developing the game.

Failures: We had two meetings planned but were only able to go through with one.

Barriers: N/A

What we should try next time: Potentially getting the deliverable done earlier so we can get feedback earlier and have more time to change things



## 3. Next Steps
Elizabeth- Add UI tutorial and flesh out tutorial more such as adding a shop item to interact with for the respective section.

Ethan - Continue working on combat mechanics, help others with any implementations that are needed. Maybe start working on boss mechanics.

Gordon - Finish pixel art of chimera

Maya - Finish and upload the 3 consumables/upgrades created last week, start on 3 more.

Asher - Finish adding new items, start working on boss

Chandler - Clean up level interactions with enemies, create new art assets and level objects for a larger visual and gameplay variety.

Camelia - Finish sprite for player character's wife and convert concept art to pixel art.
