Elizabeth:

Gordon:

Maya: 

Camelia: 

Chandler: Imported new level assets and setup a basic level design with different types of obstacles (gaps allow projectiles to cross but not entities, walls prevent either from crossing)


2. Retrospective

    Appreciations: Cleaning up unused branches, have 2 more people join for art.
    Successes: Gordon getting a sprite done even before first meeting, purchasable item system is complete
    Failures: A lot of time was spent reviewing pull requests.
    Barriers: Some pull requests are hard to understand because the diff is so big.
    What we should try next time. 
    Add multiple commits per branch being pull requested rather than 1 big pull request to make PRS easier to review.

3. Next steps

Ethan: Add knockback to enemy and player strikes

Asher: 2 upgrades, 1 consumable in code 

Elizabeth: Transfering potions between scenes

Gordon: Main character sprite variations

Maya: 3 sprites for items

Camelia: Different sprite for ranged enemies

Chandler: Clean up level interactions and enemy pathfinding accordingly
